# Odin
Nitish Tripathi, 2017

Odin is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and running on top of Theano. 
# 

It is under development with a focus on easy implementation of deep neural network. Currently it supports only convolution neural network. However, work is in progress to implement recurrent neural network.

Odin allows for easy and fast prototyping through user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility.
