# Odin
Nitish Tripathi, 2017

Odin is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and running on top of Theano. 
 
It is under development with a focus on easy implementation of deep neural network. Currently it supports only convolution neural network. However, work is in progress to implement recurrent neural network.

Odin allows for easy and fast prototyping through user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To get started with odin, you will need following requirements:
* Python == 2.7
* Theano >= 0.9
 * Latest version of theano is recommended.
 * A detailed information about how to install can be found here: http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html
* NumPy >= 1.9.1 <= 1.12
 * Although odin also works with the latest version of numpy, theano recommends the above numpy versions.
